## 💰 Final Cost Estimate

**Monthly Operating Costs (Phase 8 Complete):**
```
AWS Services:
├─ RDS PostgreSQL (db.t3.small)  ........  $20/month
├─ S3 Storage + Requests  .............   $5/month
├─ Lambda (1000 invokes/month)  .......   $0.20/month
├─ CloudWatch (monitoring)  ...........   $2/month
├─ Data Transfer  .....................   $10/month
└─ Subtotal AWS ........................  $37/month

Third-Party Services:
├─ Streamlit Cloud (Pro)  ..............  $10/month
└─ Domain + Email  .....................  $1/month

TOTAL MONTHLY COST: ~$48/month ✅

Annual Cost: ~$576 (still very reasonable!)
```

**For 1,000 invoices/month**, that's $0.048 per invoice processed.
